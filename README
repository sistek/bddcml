Multilevel BDDC solver library 
==============================

Install notes: 
--------------

1. Create a make.inc within the main directory - can be done by editing make.inc.example
   make sure all necessary external libraries are available:
   These include: 
   BLOPEX ( http://code.google.com/p/blopex ) 
   MUMPS  ( http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/MUMPS )  
   ParMETIS ( http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/parmetis/overview )
   LAPACK ( http://www.netlib.org/lapack ) 
   BLAS ( http://www.netlib.org/blas )
    ( LAPACK and BLAS are often included in numerical libraries such as MKL )

2. type make 
   This should first compile object and modules of src/ folder, 
   create library libbddcml.a in lib/ folder,
   and finally compile example solvers in examples/ solver.

The library provides a simple interface callable from Fortran and C. The solution proces is
operated by several routines consequently called. 

Two different modes ara possible for input 
- user can either provide information about global mesh and a file with element matrices, or
- user can provide division into subdomains on the first level and pass 
  subdomain matrices for each subdomain to the routine
